# SZ_PINT
scripts used for analysis of PINT in SZ samples 

## Notes as of 2018-02-08

For Stratium:
1. Running PINT increased the correlation between the cortical network and the expected subregion of the striatum.
    + nice extra validation for PINT
2. Looking at straitum-to-cortical connectivity (we see strong case-control differences) robust to PINT
   + note: using network-wise analysis, bonferroni corrected against 6 network or 12 `network*hemishphere` comparisons.
3. For Edge-wise comparision (pre and post pint):
   + FPP1R - FPP1L connectivity is greater in SSD before PINT, but no differences after PINT


To-Do: 
 - [] Remove the possibly duplicated ZHH data
 - [] Fix that one guy in COBRE
 - [] Maybe? Rerun PINT using recommended settings from final draft of PINT paper
 - [] Lit search on excutive-network/ frontal parietal network connectivity in SSD
     - [] think about looking a neurocongitive scores for secondary analysis
 - [] Extract Anatomical measures into a spreadsheets so that we can rerun the Dayton Analyses
      - [] Sulcal Depth (per person/per ROI/pre and post PINT)
      - [] gyrification index?

# SZ_PINT
scripts used for analysis of PINT in SZ samples

## Notes as of 2018-02-08

For Stratium:
1. Running PINT increased the correlation between the cortical network and the expected subregion of the striatum.
    + nice extra validation for PINT
2. Looking at straitum-to-cortical connectivity (we see strong case-control differences) https://github.com/dmiranda13/SZ_PINT.gitrobust to PINT
   + note: using network-wise analysis, bonferroni corrected against 6 network or 12 `network*hemishphere` comparisons.
3. For Edge-wise comparision (pre and post pint):
   + FPP1R - FPP1L connectivity is greater in SSD before PINT, but no differences after PINT
   

To-Do:
 - [] add ICV to the displacement stats
 -
